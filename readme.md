### Tweak Compatability

Quasar may conflict with tweaks that affect the App Switcher. Tweaks like [Gesto](https://repo.dynastic.co/package/gesto13) must be configured when using Quasar's page views, while others like [KillControl](https://repo.ginsu.dev/depiction/web/com.ginsu.killcontrol.html) function as expected. More compatability will come with future updates.

In order to report a conflict with Quasar, please file a [bug report]().

### Known Issues

Context menus for elements of Quasar's interface do not display properly when being viewed from an iPad while in landscape mode. This is due to Apple's orientation design and is currently disabled, however a fix is top priority.

### Bug Reporting

If you are facing an issue with Quasar's functionality, please file a [bug report]() and make sure to include all needed information.
